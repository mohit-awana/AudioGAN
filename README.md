# AudioGAN

This project explores training RNN-based GANs on voice signals using the AudioMNIST dataset. The goal is to experiment with generative modeling for speech data, evaluate how RNNs perform in adversarial setups, and provide a learning-oriented framework for audio-based deep learning research.
